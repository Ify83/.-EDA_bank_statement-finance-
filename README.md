This is an Excel project. It marks the beginning of my journey into understanding and working with data. I am eager to learn and use Excel to uncover insights regarding one of my bank accounts used primarily for handling short term miscellaneous activities, and make things better. My exploration reveals fascinating insights into several key aspects: from account average cumulative balance to categorization of entries and their balances. We delve into questions such as which category of entries has the highest average cumulative balance and which has the lowest average cumulative balance, etc.
For this project, I utilized my Accessbank transactions’ statement. It was downloaded from my bank app in PDF file. I then converted it into an Excel file. The dataset, organized in an Excel spreadsheet, includes the following columns:
Posted Date: The date of transaction entry. 
Description: The nature of posted transaction entry 
Debit: Transaction entries depicting the “outflow” of funds from the said account. 
Credit: Transaction entries depicting the “inflow” of funds into the said account. 
Balance: The average cumulative amount at a given point in time
